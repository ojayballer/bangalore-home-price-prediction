- Area (in square feet)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Area type (e.g., Carpet Area, Super Built-up)
- Location
##  Model Training

All code for training the model (including data cleaning, outlier removal, feature encoding,hyperparameter_tuning and model saving) is located in:
[➡️ model_training/model_building.py](model_training/model_building.py)


##  How It Works

You enter values in the frontend, and the model predicts price using a trained Linear Regression model served via Flask.
